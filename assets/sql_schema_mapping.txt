- (referenced events/evidence_for_chemical_initiation) -> molecular_initiating_event/evidence_supporting_chemical_initiation
- SAME AS molecular_initiating_event will be adverse_outcome (elaboration on next line)

ED: One thing missing ? How to determine which key events are molecular initiating for an aop an which are adverse outcome for an aop.

// table: aop_relationships maps to -> key_event_relationships.
- sequence of relationship, references relationships (the scientific word, not the db relational meaning).
- directness: 0 = direct, 1 = indirect (YES, THE BOOLEAN IS INVERSED IN THE SQL) (recommend a better name).
XXXX- evidence_id -> evidence (?) - bad naming
XXXX- quantitative_understanding_id -> quantitative_understanding_value (?) - bad naming
- row_order (implied by sequence).
- created_at / updated_at -> (ignored).

// table: aop_stressors maps to -> aop_stressors
- sequence references aop_stressor, references stressor
- evidence_id -> evidence
- evidence_text -> description

// Complex type: applicability contains explicit children [sex, life_stage, taxonomy].
- sex, life_stage -> (these are evidence types and have an additional restricted string 'sex' or 'life_stage')
- taxonomy -> (this is an evidence type and have an additional taxonomy_term_id reference).

// ANSWER TO LINGERING QUESTION:
To determine molecular initiating event, use the lowest row_order aop_relationship record related to the current aop to reach the relationship table and then get the upstream event id of the upstream event id from the same table.
- Query:
SELECT mie_r.upstream_event_id, r.upstream_event_id
FROM
    aop_relationships AS ar
    INNER JOIN relationships AS r
    ON ar.relationship_id = r.id
    INNER JOIN relationships AS mie_r
    ON mie_r.downstream_event_id = r.upstream_event_id
WHERE aop_id = 12
ORDER BY row_order ASC
LIMIT 1
--- THEORY HOLDS

// ANSWER TO LINGERING QUESTION:
To determine adverse outcome event, use the highest row_order aop_relationship record related to the current aop to reach the relationship table then get the downstream event id of the downstream event id from the same table.
SELECT r.upstream_event_id, ao_r.downstream_event_id
FROM
    aop_relationships AS ar
    INNER JOIN relationships AS r
    ON ar.relationship_id = r.id
    INNER JOIN relationships AS ao_r
    ON ao_r.downstream_event_id = r.downstream_event_id
WHERE aop_id = 121
ORDER BY row_order DESC
LIMIT 1
^^^ XXXXXXX Theory doesn't hold

XXX NEED TO ASK AOPWIKI PEOPLE: HOW DO THEY DETERMINE MIE AND AO from the chain and relationships.
